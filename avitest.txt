Claude 3.5 Sonnet > Claude 3 Opus/GPT4o !
Well it happened again and another SOTA model is out, just 1 month or so after GPT4o, and is better on almost all the benchmarks.
And it has Agentic capabilities.
And its available for free.. (for now anyway and in a limited amount)
Hope you understand the script already of the exponential improvement.
And all those who says that AI is slowing down - hope you will learn your lesson - It cant slow down..
Its like compound interest in money..
And now more and more come out and say what i was saying all along - AGI (and therefor ASI) is around the corner, 2027 is the year they all (un-relatably) say, but i dont know or care about the specific year, but it will be around that time and definitely before 2030.
and then the Economy is soon to follow (say in 2040) and respond to that with much much more layoffs, and then collapse and then anarchy UNLESS we do something about it now!
15 years might sound like a lot of time, but in comparison of changing the socio-economic system its a very very short time.
So if you want a world where you dont have to fight for bread or even just die before that because of WW3 over resources and land - wake up and start being active now towards this change. ALMOST everything else doesn't matter.

@Avi Dashevski I've been thinking similar time scales as yourself. I'm not sure about ASI yet as models that are fed synthetic token data actually get dumber.
It depends if transformers are only storing programs or they are actually reasoning. Which ATM I don't believe they are. There are two trains of thought here that the top people are talking about and I mean the scientist not the hype merchants or CEOs are saying to VCs. The issue is training data. If we only get close to a very smart person that probably won't be able to make ASI as it needs SI training data which doesn't exist. So I'm a little on the fence about ASI for now.
I think it's going to be a slower take off than people expect. As much of what we think a post AGI world looks like is more related to infrastructure as you touched on. Everything digital will be turned upside down but the physical systems will take far far longer to modernize.
I've worked in infrastructure for decades so I understand the length of time it takes to actually build something rather than spitting out some tokens no matter how smart they are.
Yeah robots but there is already high demand for minerals for the batteries, I would probably say if AGI does happen it's going to be more agentic with human oversight. I think we are about to enter a mini winter for about a year or two until AGI is achieved. As the uncanny valley of intelligence will be an issue. A machine that only works properly 95% of the time is more useless than a machine that works 0% of the time as it takes human effort to correct those mistakes. I know a lot of big companies are scaling back Ai as it can't actually provide good enough results to be fully integrated.
That doesn't mean I'm not bullish my expectations have been tempered in the last few weeks. I have a feeling the long tail is longer than we thought. We still haven't sorted self driving and that's been ongoing for much longer than LLMs. So I'm on the fence ATM unless new break thrus are coming.
I am aware of one that I can't talk about but that's more like a 10/20 year timeline... This is one of the main players. Can't say anything else there

I tried it. It's cool, but I only got 5 messages to try it unless I upgrade to Pro. Not a lot if you ask me! I want to try their APIs though.

@Avi Dashevski Undoubtedly, AGI is coming.
You say "the Economy is soon to follow" which I assume you mean AGI is going to disrupt the economic system. I agree, but I think it will be a positive thing.
People always get concerned when a new technology arrives. It's happened throughout history. What tends to happen are these technologies create new economies and jobs.
The "creative destruction" coined by Joseph Schumpeter states that innovation replace and make obsolete older innovations. This happens constantly and AGI will certainly hasten this. Current technologies and economies will change.
There would be growing pains that come with such a change, but I see the change in the socio-economic system to be a good one as long as the AI technologies can also be open-sourced to the public and not kept proprietary and in the hands of companies that own them. If open-sourced is banned and certain companies own the control of information and therefore the economy, yes, I would definitely worry more.

@Joshua Alm Of course if there will be a socio-economic change from capitalism - then yes, im not worried.
But its not a given that there will be such a change.
And without it, yes, there will be collapse because capitalism cant sustain the situation where most people dont work.
And again - there wont be any new "jobs", meaning no employer would want to pay you, for something they can just achieve using and AGI inside a robot or a service by just describing and having a chat about their need to it (the AGI robot or service) for much much much less than they would need to pay you...

What are some of the Agentic capabilities it has. Can you give a few examples?

@Saseshmu Herut mainly iterability if i remember correctly, but that doesnt matter so much, since it will be used in agentic frameworks anyway as well..

@Avi Dashevski It's only a matter of time before OpenAI has to drop GPT-5
the question then is... how good will it be?

@David Ondrej pretty damn good, but then llama 4 will drop and claude 3.5 opus.. and its going to be a spiral of better and better models that improve exponentially and natively include agentic capabilities, which would mean no one would need to build agents.. and then AGI in 2027 or 2030 maximum...

@David Ondrej Claude 3.5's benchmarks will presumably pressure OpenAI to release 5.0 sooner than later, meaning less time for red teaming, guardrails, and nerfing. So probably pretty good! Initially, anyway...

I spent the whole day with it. Its a wet dream for a no coder!
The code/preview window was brilliant to use, working on styling was a unique experience. Explanations on your prompt window, code cycling through the code window, and then being able to see the end product was so convenient.
Was lucky with my timing getting in. No chat limits until later in the night.
Is there anything you guys use that has that kind of preview experience?

I haven't played with Claude 3.5 Sonnet yet but I'll be diving into it today. I just watched Matt Wolfe's video showcasing Sonnet's capabilities and I was extremely impressed. What stood out to me is that it has artefact features which lets Claude 3.5 Sonnet independently write, edit, and execute code which to me seems like a serious devin.ai contender. The best part is, Claude 3.5 Sonnet is actually free. Where do you guys think Claude 3.5 sonnet will cause the biggest disruption in AI? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKtetzLsk0

@John Castagnoli If you blindly follow what David Shapiro or some other people say then we wont be able to really talk to each other..
You should use first principle thinking and think through why i said what i said.
Btw, yes, David Shapiro is smart, smart in the sense that he knows a lot, and knows how to be articulated and present-full.
That doesnt mean he knows what the hell he is talking about, for example (and im saying that even though i agree and support the general direction of his videos) he doesnt really understand economics, and im saying that after talking to an economist, and yes, in America, the same place Shapiro is from..
So use your ability for logic + rereading my post again, to answer your questions, dont trust me.
And btw, he just made the AI slowing down video 1 week or so before Claude 3.5 sonnet released, and thats not all that happened, you can bet there is SOO much stuff you dont even hear about because they are in the form of papers that no one implemented yet..
Nothing from what i said is speculation - its just deduction and reasoning.
just like when scientist told us that climate change is coming it wasnt a speculation. it was deduction of what will happen if we will continue on the same trajectory. and since profit was and is involved it was clear that we would continue on it, barely straying from it...

@Avi Dashevski "If you blindly follow what David Shapiro or some other people say" - well that's a little rude lol - "scientist told us that climate change is coming it wasnt a speculation. it was deduction of what will happen if we will continue on the same trajectory" - yes, just like they told us about Covid and everything they said was true on that. Good deal.

We're running out of water and energy, so unless you're pulling nuclear fusion out of your magicians hat, we're gonna see some sort of slow-down. We could of course fire up coal plant by the thousands lol (which China is well on their way on doing) - but that raises up ethical and ecological concerns. - Water and Energy: still finite at this current moment in our epoch:)

@John Castagnoli on that i agree. resources are a hard limit.
But anyway, my main point was that we need to change the system because if we wont, we either going to
reach AGI ---> the capitalist system will crash ---> chaos and anarchy on the streets WW3.
start running out of resources ---> nations and corporations fighting over the remaining ones because they are in a serious competition (and in general bet a lot of money on it, they wont just abandon it) to reach AGI ---> WW3
start running out of ...

What if it already happened and @David Ondrej doesn‚Äôt actually exist but is an Elon Gen 3 robot, Only kidding. I have mixed feelings and not really sure how we can prepare or that the outcome will necessary be bad. I guess a lot of it will have to do with how fast we can adapt. I am quietly optimistic.
